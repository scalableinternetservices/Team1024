Project Description:


The Big Picture
Singlefile eliminate the physical line for popular events where priority is a concern. We replace long lines with a shorter physical line and a better virtual line. 

At first, businesses provide us all the related info about the event or store, such as: location, start time, ticket information, capacity, etc.. Then, the virtual line for either purchasing tickets or entering the event (the process is relatively the same) starts some time before the event begins. 

The virtual line’s core logic is similar to a physical line in the "real-world" :

1.People who join the line earlier should have a better position

2.People can lose their position if they're inattentive or leave the line

3.Those who spend more time and energy in line will get a better chance of entering the event or purchasing tickets.

Put simply, the purpose of this virtual line is to provide a prioritization process that is as ‘fair’ and easy as possible while also reducing everybody’s burden(both participants and organizers) at the same time.
